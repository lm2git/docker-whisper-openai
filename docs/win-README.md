#  Docker Installation Guide on Windows (with Docker Desktop)
This guide shows you how to install Docker Desktop on Windows.

## Steps for installation on Windows:
Download Docker Desktop for Windows: Go to the official Docker website and download Docker Desktop for Windows:

Download Docker Desktop for Windows
Run the installer: Launch the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions. During installation, Docker Desktop will ask you to enable virtualization in the computer's BIOS if it is not already enabled.

Enable WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux): Docker Desktop uses WSL 2 as the backend on Windows. If you haven't set it up yet, Docker Desktop will guide you through the process to install it. If you prefer to do it manually, follow these steps:

Open PowerShell as an administrator and run:

```bash
wsl --install
 ```

If the above command doesn't work, you can follow this link to configure WSL 2.
Launch Docker Desktop: After installation, launch Docker Desktop from the Start menu. Docker may take a few minutes to start.

Sign in (optional): You can create a Docker account (or log in with an existing account) to access additional services offered by Docker, such as Docker Hub. However, it is not necessary to run containers.

Verify the installation: Once Docker Desktop is running, open PowerShell or the terminal and verify that Docker is correctly installed by running:

```bash
docker --version
```


Troubleshooting

Docker startup error on Windows: If Docker doesn't start, try rebooting the system. Also, ensure that virtualization is enabled in the BIOS (this is required for Docker to work correctly on Windows).

WSL issues on Windows: If you encounter issues with WSL, make sure you have correctly set up WSL 2 by following the instructions in the Docker guide or on the official Microsoft site for WSL.
